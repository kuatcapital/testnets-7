### Using Cosmovisor

Download binary and genesis (Note: genesis only needed if syncing from scratch):

- Binary from: https://github.com/entrypoint-zone/testnets/releases/tag/v1.2.0.
- Genesis from: https://github.com/entrypoint-zone/testnets/blob/main/entrypoint-pubtest-2/genesis.json.

For convenience, copy the downloaded binary to `$GOPATH/bin/` with the name `entrypointd` for easy execution:

- `cp <downloaded-binary> $GOPATH/bin/entrypointd` (make sure `$GOPATH` variable exists)

Initialise node config files:

- `entrypointd init <node-name> --chain-id entrypoint-pubtest-2`.

Install and configure Cosmovisor:

- Install Cosmovisor: `go install cosmossdk.io/tools/cosmovisor/cmd/cosmovisor@latest`.
- If you need a specific version of go you can run e.g. `go install golang.org/dl/go1.20@latest`. The executable will be `go1.20` in this example.
- Set environment variables:
    ```bash
    echo "# Setup Cosmovisor" >> ~/.profile
    echo "export DAEMON_NAME=entrypointd" >> ~/.profile
    echo "export DAEMON_HOME=$HOME/.entrypoint" >> ~/.profile
    echo "export DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=true" >> ~/.profile
    echo "export DAEMON_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE=512" >> ~/.profile
    echo "export DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true" >> ~/.profile
  
    # Check https://docs.cosmos.network/main/tooling/cosmovisor for more configuration options.
    ```
- Apply environment variables: `source ~/.profile`.
- Initialise Cosmovisor directories: `cosmovisor init <path-to-entrypointd-binary>`.

Configure node:

- Configure `minimum-gas-prices` in `nano ~/.entrypoint/config/app.toml`.
  - Recommended value: `0.01ibc/8A138BC76D0FB2665F8937EC2BF01B9F6A714F6127221A0E155106A45E09BCC5`.
- Configure `persistent_peers` in `nano ~/.entrypoint/config/config.toml`.
  - Recommended value: `persistent_peers = "81bf2ade773a30eccdfee58a041974461f1838d8@185.107.68.148:26656,d57c7572d58cb3043770f2c0ba412b35035233ad@80.64.208.169:26656"`.
- Move the downloaded genesis file to `~/.entrypoint/config/genesis.json` if you're syncing from scratch.
- Configure State Sync in `$DAEMON_HOME/config/config.toml` by following [this guide](https://explorer.entrypoint.zone/entrypoint/statesync).
  - Remember to add the port to the RPC server: `https://testnet-rpc.entrypoint.zone:443`
  - Two RPC servers are needed, and it is recommended to find a different RPC server, but the same one can be reused.

At this point `cosmovisor run` will be the equivalent of running `entrypointd`. In fact, to run the node you can use `cosmovisor run start`. **It is highly recommended to run the EntryPoint as a service**, so that it can run in the background. You will need to replicate the environment variables defined above.

Here's an example service file with some placeholder (`<...>`) values:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=EntryPoint Node
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=<USER>
ExecStart=<HOME>/go/bin/cosmovisor run start --home <NODE-HOME>
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096

Environment="DAEMON_NAME=entrypointd"
Environment="DAEMON_HOME=/home/<USER>/.entrypoint"  # Double-check this!
Environment="DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=true"
Environment="DAEMON_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE=512"
Environment="DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

At this point you should visit the [Scheduled Upgrades](./UPGRADES.md) page for details on current and upcoming versions.

### Become a Validator

EntryPoint currently uses `ibc/8A138BC76D0FB2665F8937EC2BF01B9F6A714F6127221A0E155106A45E09BCC5` (ATOM) as the fee token and `uentry` (ENTRY) for voting power. In order to become a validator you will need to request an amount of both of these tokens from the testnet maintainers.

### Handling Upgrades Using Cosmovisor

The public testnet is expected to require upgrades as new features are added or bugs are discovered. This is a rough guide for handling upgrades using Cosmovisor:

- Download new binary from https://github.com/entrypoint-zone/testnets/releases or obtain it from a reputable source.
- Apply environment variables: `source ~/.profile`.
- Register the upgrade: `cosmovisor add-upgrade <upgrade-name> <path-to-new-entrypointd-binary>`.
- Wait for the upgrade height and monitor your node's logs to ensure everything goes well.
